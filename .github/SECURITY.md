**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing the maintainers at [INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS] or through our [security advisory form](https://github.com/your-username/polymarket-dashboard/security/advisories/new) if available.
